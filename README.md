# Research Question
The Effect of significant life events, e.g., marriage, birth of children, migration, etc, on women's career levels, measured by income quantile. Make comparison with men.

# Data Source
National Longitudinal Surveys

# Research Methods
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Multinominal logistic regression
3. Clustering (KNN)
4. Visualization 

# Output
1. An interactive visual system **Work-Life Visualization(WLViz)**. Demo video of the system see: [https://youtu.be/pJEG_RyMWJ4](https://youtu.be/pJEG_RyMWJ4)
2. A paper: *Towards Better Understanding of the Workâ€“Life Dynamics* (not publish yet)

# Findings
Based on the descriptive and regression analysis of the data, we discovered:

1. The rate of women having children is higher than men.
2. Women's income quantile distribution is noticeably lower than men's, and this distribution is not alleviated throughout their career life.
3. Among the frequent career sequence patterns, there is a type of career path for women that goes from a high quantile to a low one (constantly decreasing), which is very inconsistent with the usual logic of career development. However, this did not happen in the more frequent careers for men.
4. Women's career paths typically involve small increases (from level 3 to level 4) if ascending, or consistent declines (from level 4 to 3 to 2 to 1) if descending.

5. The varying impacts of marriage on men and women:
- Women:
  - Most women choose to marry at a conventional time.
  - As marital status stabilizes, husbands or family support likely continues to exist.
  - Women at Level 5 are less inclined to quit or downgrade in their jobs (Matthew effect? Or is the cost of quitting too high?).
  - Unmarried women struggle more persistently against declining levels.
  - Marriage assists in upward mobility and becomes increasingly achievable.
  - In the later stages of marriage, such as stage 7, marriage plays a negative role, making it easier for women to fall from middle-low income to low (perhaps middle-low income jobs are more prone to unemployment with age?).
- Men:
  - High-income men find partners more easily.
  - Men face fewer obstacles in income mobility compared to women.
  - Marriage in the mid-term aids men in reaching higher levels.

6. The differing impacts of having children on men and women:

- Women:
  - High-income women generally choose not to have children too early (stage 2, 3).
  - Raising children has a significant negative impact on women who are just entering their careers.
  - Compared to early career stages 2-3, having children in stage 4 may not lead directly to low income, but rather a "down then up" pattern, which seems more acceptable to some extent?
- Men:
  - The higher the income, the earlier the marriage, and consequently the earlier the children.
  - A man's career path seems to have less correlation with whether or not he has children.
